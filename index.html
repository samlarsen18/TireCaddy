      <h2>How it Works</h2>
      <p>Nobody likes having their winter tires laying around at home for 9 months of the year. We'll take care of the storage.
        You let us know the tire service center you get your tires changed and we'll come pick them up. When the season is over,
        let us know where you would like to have your tires delivered and they'll be waiting for you.</p>
